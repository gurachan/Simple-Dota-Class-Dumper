# Simple-Dota-Class-Dumper

This is a simple port of the class dumping module from https://github.com/LWSS/McDota to Windows.

How to use:
1) Inject the dll into dota
2) That's it. 

The class dumper will store a file called all_classes.txt in the Dota directory. Typically this is C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\dota 2 beta\game\bin\win64
